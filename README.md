# Question: How do you determine if a string has valid parentheses? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript console application determines if a string has valid parentheses by using a stack data structure and a map object. The map object is used to pair opening and closing parentheses. The application iterates over each character in the string. If the character is an opening parenthesis, it pushes the corresponding closing parenthesis from the map onto the stack. If the character is not an opening parenthesis, it is assumed to be a closing parenthesis. The application then checks if this closing parenthesis matches the last item in the stack. If it doesn't match, the function immediately returns false, indicating that the string does not have valid parentheses. If it does match, the last item is removed from the stack. After iterating through the entire string, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, the function returns true, indicating that all opening parentheses in the string have a matching closing parenthesis. If the stack is not empty, the function returns false, indicating that there are unmatched opening parentheses in the string.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution uses a generic Stack class to handle the stack operations. This class has methods to push an element onto the stack, pop an element from the stack, and check if the stack is empty. The Stack class is generic, meaning it can handle elements of any type, but in this case, it is used with strings.

The TypeScript version also uses strong typing. The function isValidParentheses is explicitly declared to take a string as an argument and return a boolean. Inside the function, the variable 'ch' is implicitly typed as a string because it is assigned the value of a character in the string 's'. The variable 'top' is implicitly typed as a string or undefined because it is assigned the value returned by the pop method of the Stack class, which can be a string or undefined if the stack is empty.

The TypeScript version does not use a map to associate opening and closing parentheses. Instead, it uses a series of if statements to check if a character is an opening parenthesis and push it onto the stack, or if it is a closing parenthesis and compare it to the top of the stack.

In terms of functionality, both the JavaScript and TypeScript versions solve the problem in the same way. They both use a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses and check if each closing parenthesis matches the last opening parenthesis that was not yet closed. The main differences are in the use of a Stack class and strong typing in the TypeScript version.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a similar approach to the JavaScript version, but with some differences due to the language features and syntax.

1. Data Structures: Both versions use a stack to keep track of the opening parentheses. In JavaScript, an array is used as a stack with the push and pop methods. In C++, a stack from the Standard Template Library (STL) is used with the push, pop, and top methods.

2. Looping: In JavaScript, a for loop is used to iterate over the string. In C++, a range-based for loop is used, which is a feature not available in JavaScript.

3. Checking Parentheses: In JavaScript, an object is used to map opening parentheses to their corresponding closing parentheses. In the if-else statement, it checks if the current character is in the map (i.e., is an opening parenthesis) and if so, it pushes the corresponding closing parenthesis onto the stack. In C++, a switch statement is used to check the type of the current character. If it's an opening parenthesis, it's pushed onto the stack. If it's a closing parenthesis, it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack is not the corresponding opening parenthesis, and if either is true, it returns false; otherwise, it pops the top of the stack.

4. Input/Output: The JavaScript version tests the function with hard-coded strings and logs the results to the console. The C++ version prompts the user for a string and prints the result to the console.

5. Error Handling: The JavaScript version implicitly handles invalid characters by ignoring them (since they won't be in the map). The C++ version explicitly handles invalid characters with a default case in the switch statement that does nothing (i.e., it passes).

6. Return Value: Both versions return whether the stack is empty at the end, which indicates whether all opening parentheses have been closed.
